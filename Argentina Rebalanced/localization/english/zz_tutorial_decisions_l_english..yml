 law_1420_decision_desc:0 "Law 1420 is based on three pillars. First of all, free education so as not to leave out any boy or girl. The school had to be accessible to all, fundamentally in a context where the illiteracy rate was very high. In addition, literacy was essential for citizen education within the framework of a national State that was in its early stages of formation. The need to form a new political subject after the end of the colonial model. Secondly, the obligation implied providing a common basis for all subjects who attended school. Education then appeared as a right. The third element that characterizes the law is secularism, since religious education should be dictated outside class hours and by ministers of worship."
